- ⚡ Here's a fun fact about data:
The amount of data created and consumed globally is growing at an exponential rate. It's estimated that by 2025, the global datasphere will reach 181 zettabytes. To put that into perspective, one zettabyte is equal to a trillion gigabytes! If you were to store all that data on standard DVDs, the stack would reach **beyond the moon and back** several times over!

**Let's Go!** 🚀 🚀
