# Hello there 👋, I'm Oluwadare Oluwaseun Emmanuel.

#### I'm a Data Analyst and I'm passionate about understanding the potential role of Data in driving decision-making in an ever-expanding world 🌍

## ✨ Here's a peephole into my world ✨

- 🔭 I am currently working on a learn-as-you-build data project with python and it promises to be an exciting project.
- 🌱 I now possess advanced knowledge on Excel, SQL for data analysis, and Tableau for visualizations and dashboarding. I am currently working on utilizing the python ecosystem and I hope to achieve big data milestones with it. I will then be moving on to Power BI later on.  🕶️ I'm excited for the journey 😊 As I should! 😂
- 🤔 I’m looking for an opportunity to satisfy my curiosity about data and its role in driving decision-making.

- ⚡ Here's a fun fact about data:
The amount of data created and consumed globally is growing at an exponential rate. It's estimated that by 2025, the global datasphere will reach 181 zettabytes. To put that into perspective, one zettabyte is equal to a trillion gigabytes! If you were to store all that data on standard DVDs, the stack would reach **beyond the moon and back** several times over!

**Let's Go!** 🚀 🚀
