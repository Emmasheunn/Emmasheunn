# Hello there 👋, I'm Oluwadare Oluwaseun Emmanuel.

#### I'm a Data Analyst and I'm passionate about understanding the potential role of Data in driving decision-making in an ever-expanding world 🌍

## ✨ Here's a peephole into my world ✨

- 🔭 I recently completed an SQL-BASED personal data analytics project on Sales data.
- 🌱 I now possess advanced knowledge on Excel and SQL for data analysis, and will be looking to achieve the same feat in Tableau and Power BI for visualizations. I will then be moving on to utilizing the python ecosystem to achieve big data milestones 🕶️ I'm excited for the journey 😊 As I should! 😂
- 🤔 I’m looking for an opportunity to satisfy my curiosity about data and its role in driving decision-making.

- ⚡ Here's a fun fact about data:
The amount of data created and consumed globally is growing at an exponential rate. It's estimated that by 2025, the global datasphere will reach 181 zettabytes. To put that into perspective, one zettabyte is equal to a trillion gigabytes! If you were to store all that data on standard DVDs, the stack would reach **beyond the moon and back** several times over!

*Join me on my journey to the moon* 🌙 
**Let's Go!** 🚀 🚀
